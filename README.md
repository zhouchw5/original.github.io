Considering some privacy issues, I determine to transfer my resume here to my local repository.            
                  
                  
I would send my updated resume to my ideal organization and now I think I have encountered such a company.                  
           
           
If you are one of my colleagues in that company for the coming future,          
and coincidentally interested in my profile, with my great honor,            
after reading my resume you are still curious about more information,                
you can either keep further reading in my website [www.zhouchuwei.com](https://www.zhouchuwei.com/),                 
or get access to my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ClarenceZhou/).
