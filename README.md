# Chuwei Zhou                 

Considering some privacy issues, I determine to transfer my resume here to my local repository. Only when I start my online application for employment would I reopen the 'exhibition' of my resumne here. But any valuable communication via **email** or mobile phone is welcomed, with my resume or any other information in your curiosity.          
          
Yours,          
Zhou Mr.Chuwei
