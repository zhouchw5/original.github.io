## Work Experience     
### HUWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD.     
**Supply Chain Management Engineer_Global Master Planner of IT Products**    
_Medium and long term resource planning of Huawei IT products (including Server, Storage and other series IT solutions); Three main working modules: **Demand/Supply Mathch, Logistics Optimization** and **Global Allocations Management** (based on operations research, data analysis and projects information)_         
- **Modeling and Programming**: Developed an iteration model computing the supply allocation for Tencent typical projects, by programming in Python Spyder and building up a visualization and interaction interface of data report in Tableau Desktop, awarded as **the Junior Data Analyst** in Huawei            
- **Leadership and Cooperation Capacity**: Indenpendently managed the global planning in supply chain of series IT products, defusing the industrial supply shortage of some vital component products in the first and second quarter in 2018, contributing to IT products line achieveing the Huawei's largest product line in delivering amount 
- **Innovative Problem-solving**: Participated in developing packaging prediction models for vital component products, increasing the prediction accuracy of the Huawei Hard Disk Drive's future cargo data to 85%, ranking No.1 in the department in the first and second quarter in 2018

## Selected Research/Coursework Projects     
**_Research on the Black Hole Paradox and the AMPS Paradox_**     
This research aimed to unfold the mathematical framework of the Black Hole Paradox and the AMPS Paradox and study some deep connection among Thermodynamics, General Relativity and Quantum Theory, with some mathematical methods like the quantization of gravitation field, Bogoliubov Transformation and Temperature Green Function. This research won me the Excellent Graduate Thesis of Sun Yat-Sen University.    
     
**_Fractal Brownian Motion Model to Simulate the Stock Index Time Series_**     
This research was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the stock index time series and predict the corresponding transition probability.    

**_The Multi-objective Nonlinear Programming on The Hot Bath Model (MCM coompetition)_**      
This programme was to develop a model of the temperature control system that described the temperature of the bathtub water in space and time. Then determined the best strategy to achieve the multiple objectives: temperature-preservation and water-saving.    
- Applied the stability theory of differential equations to obtain the stable temperatures and the corresponding flow rates of hot water, then considered the flow rate function as one of the objective functions.      
- Developed the space-time distribution model of temperature and determined the temperature deviation as another objective function related to the stable temperatures, subjected to the constraint interval.      
- Utilized Expert Evaluation Method to allocate the weights of objective functions, then determined a stable temperature.
