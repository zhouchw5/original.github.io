Considering some privacy issues, I determine to transfer my resume here to my local repository. Only when I start my online application for employment would I reopen the 'exhibition' of my resumne here. But any valuable communication via **email** or mobile phone is welcomed, with my resume or any other information in your curiosity. _**Another recommended option is that you can click the blue button below with "查看职业档案" to connect with my brief profile.**_          
              
<table><tr><td bgcolor=PowderBlue>查看职业档案</td></tr></table>
