## Work Experience     
### HUWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD.     
**Supply Chain Management Engineer**    
_To achieve the best strategy for demand fulfillment, my main job can be divided into three main modules: **Demand/Supply Mathch, Logistics Optimization** and **Allocations Management**._      
- Developed an iteration model computing the supply allocation for typical projects, by programming in Python Spyder and building up a visualization and interaction interface of data report in Tableau Desktop      
- Analyze the historical outbound information and predict the future cargo quantity, by using the linear regression model, moving average method, exponential smoothing, or optimal allocation model selectively, then make the procurement plan      
- Monitor the items' supply and demand, feedback those in low or lack of inventory      
- Order purchasing plan for those items in low inventory, and make plans to consume the overstock items      
- Determine the priority levels of contracts and optimize the resource allocation, with some quantitative methods like the (0-1) programming model      




      
## Selected Research/Coursework Projects     
**_Research on the Black Hole Paradox and the AMPS Paradox_**     
This research aimed to unfold the mathematical framework of the Black Hole Paradox and the AMPS Paradox and study some deep connection among Thermodynamics, General Relativity and Quantum Theory, with some mathematical methods like the quantization of gravitation field, Bogoliubov Transformation and Temperature Green Function. This research won me the Excellent Graduate Thesis of Sun Yat-Sen University.    
     
**_Fractal Brownian Motion Model to Simulate the Stock Index Time Series_**     
This research was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the stock index time series and predict the corresponding transition probability.    

**_The Multi-objective Nonlinear Programming on The Hot Bath Model (MCM coompetition)_**      
This programme was to develop a model of the temperature control system that described the temperature of the bathtub water in space and time. Then determined the best strategy to achieve the multiple objectives: temperature-preservation and water-saving.    
- Applied the stability theory of differential equations to obtain the stable temperatures and the corresponding flow rates of hot water, then considered the flow rate function as one of the objective functions.      
- Developed the space-time distribution model of temperature and determined the temperature deviation as another objective function related to the stable temperatures, subjected to the constraint interval.      
- Utilized Expert Evaluation Method to allocate the weights of objective functions, then determined a stable temperature.
